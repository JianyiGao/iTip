## Notes

This is the first time for me to get familiar with IOS developing and I had fun doing this little project. The submitted file is the third version of the tip calculator. Comparing with the last two version, I managed to make this app compatible with different screen sizes and improve the UI. I found it not easy to get good resources to guide me in implementing some features I would like to add, hence I would really appreciate to have the opportunity to learn IOS development with CodePath.
